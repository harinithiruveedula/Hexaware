## CASE STUDY

Case Study: **Virtual Art Gallery**
 In this case study, a Python-based Virtual Art Gallery application is developed that enables users to:

- View and control digital artwork

 - Create your own galleries.

 - Mark your favorite pieces of art.

- View information about artists and galleries.

## Database Schema
- Six tables that represented key items and relationships were included in the SQL Server database design.
-  Artists, artworks, galleries, users, and two junction tables for many-to-many mappings are all included.
- Based on the case study design, all required restrictions and foreign keys have been put in place.
